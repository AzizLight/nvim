{"name":"NVim","tagline":"Notational Velocity inspired mode for vim","body":"# NVim\r\nA [Notational Velocity][nv] inspired mode for [vim][]. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nThis should work on any recent vim compiled with `+python`. You will also need the [xapian][] library and python bindings. Note that xapian does not currently work with python3.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n````\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n````\r\nThis will install it to `/usr/local/bin/` and `/usr/local/share/nvim/`. If you want it to go somewhere else, `export PREFIX=/blah/` before calling `make;make install`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nI've made a quick screencast [here](http://showterm.io/3668688fe06b53482da16) outlining basic usage.\r\n\r\nrun `nvim` from within that directory. You will be presented with two windows - on the right is the main pane where the note is displayed; on the left the list of search results.\r\nThe first line of the search box is the current search term.\r\n\r\nUse `[[` to trigger vim's auto-complete with the list of available titles.\r\n\r\nnvim binds several keys, all combos are started with the user's defined `<leader>` key. If you haven't changed this, then it is `\\` by default.\r\n\r\n* `\\<cr>`  This will follow a '[[...]]' link from within a note.\r\n* `\\l` Move the cursor to the search area ready for changes.\r\n* `\\i` As `\\l`, but clears the current search term first (equivalent to `<esc>` on NV as remapping escape in vim is... unwise)\r\n* `\\d` Delete a note. **warning** This will delete the note pointed to by the search bar. Under normal usage this should be correct. \r\n It does not currently ask confirmation.\r\n* `\\r` Rename a note. This will *not* update any links in other notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that if you try an load a note that does not exist, the system will create a new one.\r\n\r\nThe full range of vim commands are available to you, but there are a couple of things to bear in mind:\r\n\r\n* Autosave is turned on\r\n* You can create new windows via splits or whatever as you wish - when a note is loaded from the search results it will be loaded into the most recently used window.\r\n* If you close the results window (or all windows apart from the results window) you will need to close and reopen vim.\r\n* If you delete a note or alter the contents of notes outside of nvim, then you can refresh the database as under _importing_ below.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nconfiguration is handled at the top of `nvim.vim`. The main one is the extension for notes. By default, nvim uses `.md` and will ignore files with any other extension.\r\n\r\n### Importing\r\nIf you have a bunch of notes already, then execute the following command to import them `:python nvimdb.rebuild_database()`. \r\n\r\n## TODO\r\nQuite a few things, although the code is quite usable as-is.\r\n\r\n* Allow hiding/reshowing the search results\r\n* Some proper documentation (screencasts!)\r\n\r\n [nv]: http://www.notational.net\r\n [vim]: http://www.vim.org\r\n [xapian]: http://xapian.org\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
